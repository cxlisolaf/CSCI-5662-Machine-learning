Additionally, you must make at least one submission to the **Kaggle** competition before it closes at **4:59pm on Friday February 23rd**. Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle. Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. Your solutions to analysis questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "When people are discussing popular media, there’s a concept of spoilers. That is, critical information about the plot of a TV show, book, or movie that “ruins” the experience for people who haven’t read / seen it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to do text classification on forum posts from the website [tvtropes.org](http://tvtropes.org/), to predict whether a post is a spoiler or not. We'll be using the logistic regression classifier provided by sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous assignments, the code provided with this assignment has all of the functionality required. Your job is to make the functionality better by improving the features the code uses for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Because the goal of this assignment is feature engineering, not classification algorithms, you may not change the underlying algorithm or it's parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is structured in a way that approximates how classification works in the real world: Features are typically underspecified (or not specified at all). You, the data digger, have to articulate the features you need. You then compete against others to provide useful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem straightforward, but do not start this at the last minute. There are often many things that go wrong in testing out features, and you'll want to make sure your features work well once you've found them.\n"

It should have the example Id as the first column and the prediction (`True` or `False`) as the second column. If you change this format your submissions will be scored as zero accuracy on Kaggle. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the first statement, we can see verb phrase like \"turn out\", which is a good clue for a spoiler alert! But it was predicted as \"False\" due to the fact that the trope \"ColonelMakepeace\" appears only once in the test set and did not appear in the training set.  In the second statement, trope name \"BlatantLies\" appeare several times in the sentences, and more often in True spoiler. That's the reason why the sentence was predicted as True.\n",

    "In this example, this is actually complain from the author that the episode is not allowed to air, but is misclassified as a spoiler. One way to solve such situation is to combine the \"type of trope\" feature with N-gram Tf-Idf feature, and use the feature union to model the data. \n",

I think the reason is that with the unigram and trope features, it is still good enough. In my work, the \"page\" column is not used to extract features because I found the page feature is not improving the overall accuracy. But \"page\" can be used to match with some matadata such as TV Genre, country, air year, length from website such as IMDB or Epguide.com. For the future work, these extra feature can be added to the dataset. \n",

    "> Can I heavily modify the FeatEngr class? \n",
    "\n",
    "Totally.  This was just a starting point.  The only thing you cannot modify is the LogisticRegression classifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I look at TV Tropes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain insight about the data yes, however, your feature extraction cannot use any additional data (beyond what I've given you) from the TV Tropes webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use IMDB, Wikipedia, or a dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but you are not required to. So long as your features are fully automated, they can use any dataset other than TV Tropes. Be careful, however, that your dataset does not somehow include TV Tropes (e.g. using all webpages indexed by Google will likely include TV Tropes).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I combine features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, and you probably should. This will likely be quite effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use Mechanical Turk?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not fully automatic, so no. You should be able to run your feature extraction without any human intervention. If you want to collect data from Mechanical Turk to train a classifier that you can then use to generate your features, that is fine. (But that’s way too much work for this assignment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use a Neural Network to automatically generate derived features? \n",
    "\n",
    "No. This assignment is about your ability to extract meaningful features from the data using your own experimentation and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What sort of improvement is “good” or “enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have 10-15% improvement over the baseline (on the Public Leaderboard) with your features, that’s more than sufficient. If you fail to get that improvement but have tried reasonable features, that satisfies the requirements of assignment. However, the extra credit for “winning” the class competition depends on the performance of other students.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Where do I start?  \n",
    "\n",
    "It might be a good idea to look at the in-class notebook associated with the Feature Engineering lecture where we did similar experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can I use late days on this assignment? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use late days for the write-up submission, but the Kaggle competition closes at **4:59pm on Friday February 23rd**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why does it say that the competition ends at 11:59pm when the assignment says 4:59pm? \n",
    "\n",
    "The end time/date are in UTC.  11:59pm UTC is equivalent to 4:59pm MST.  Kaggle In-Class does not allow us to change this. "
